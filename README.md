My online pseudonym for this repository is Din Djson but you can do some easy OSINTing to find my real Twitter, probably.

👋Hi!

I have a strong interest in open-source and want to find fun projects to contribute to. 

My primary interests surround ☠️Hacking☠️, 📡Vuln Research💻, 📷Astrophotography🔭, 🌠Astronomy🌠 and 👾Game Dev👾

Twitter: @DinDjson to see what sort of things I am up to.
